# JSON Config Handler for Python
Lightweight and limited (for now) JSON config file handler for projects.

* Can read and change values from and to a JSON file
* Use 'get_entry()' for getting a value given a specific key
* Use 'change_entry()' for changing a value given a specific key
* Auto backup

## To be done:

* Better documentation
* Support for nested objects (!!)
